## How does it work?
Connecting to Mercury requires spinning up a small stack in your own cloud (the templates for that stack are in this repository). After this is done we will begin collecting usage statistics from your cloud account, processing that usage data to convert it to emissions data, and making it available to you on [the dashboard](https://app.mercurycomputing.io/dashboard)
